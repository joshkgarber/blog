    <article><div><h1>Tuesday 22 July 2025</h1><h2>Boot.dev</h2><p>I continued the <a href="https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-memory-management-c">Learn Memory Management in C</a> on <a href="https://www.boot.dev/">Boot.dev</a>. It was going really well, and once I made it to 3000 XP for the day (without using potions) I decided to call it a day. So far the course mostly feels like revision of what I studied in <a href="https://github.com/joshkgarber/review50">CS50</a>.</p><p>I also received more information about the upcoming hackathon. What caught my eye was that for the judging process the project needs to take no more than 5 minutes to install locally. I had to make sure that I could make this work, so I did a quick proof-of-concept. I realized that this would be a good opportunity to practice using <code>uv</code>. I created a proof-of-concept using the following steps:</p><ul><li>Initialized a <code>uv</code> project.</li><li>Added <code>flask</code> as a dependency.</li><li>Wrote a very simple "hello world" app in <code>app.py</code>.</li><li>Ran <code>uv build</code>.</li><li>Pushed the repo to GitHub.</li></ul><p>Then, I used the GitHub documentation to learn about how to create releases. It all worked out and I documented both methods: cloning the repo or installing from <code>.whl</code>. I also plan on copying that documentation to this blog at a later date.</p><h2>InContext</h2><p>I made my first commits in over a month. That's because I decided to learn SQLAlchemy so that I'll be able to implement Flask-Permissions to handle access to managing master agents. But what I realized is that at this stage I don't need to block myself. I think that that the benefits to using an ORM outweight the costs for this project at the moment, and I'll implement it in the future. Also, the Flask-Permissions extension isn't part of the Pallets Ecosystem (not that that's necessarily a bad thing but perhaps it shows that it's not as reliable). Right now all I need is two user roles and a way to block one from accessing certain routes. I figured that this project doesn't need an extension for that (at least for now). I'm reminded of the idea that you should focus on the problem you're solving now -- the code you're writing now -- not problems or code you think you might have to write in the future. You'll cross that bridge when you come to it. So, I came up with a way to handle admin/non-admin which perfectly satisfies the requirements for the current project <a href="https://github.com/joshkgarber/masters-with-agents">Masters with Agents</a>. I added a boolean column <code>admin</code> to the table <code>users</code> to represent the admin role setting and ensured that the admin user which gets created upon database initialization receives that role. Then I created a new wrapper <code>@admin_only</code> which can be added to any route. The wrapper checks if the user has the admin role, and if not, aborts the request with a <code>403</code> status code. I modeled it off the <code>@login_required</code> wrapper function.</p><p>I finished all of the progressions on <a href="https://github.com/joshkgarber/masters-with-agents">Masters with Agents</a>. I did so mainly with the solution I mentioned above, but also by removing a couple of progressions from the list which I deemed to be unnecessary at this stage. They were nice-to-haves like breaking and re-instating inheritance on tethered agents. While I do see such features as good ideas, getting the app off the ground and into the hands of other people for feedback is a higher priority.</p><p>Having finished all the progressions, I started writing the <a href="https://github.com/joshkgarber/masters-with-agents/tree/main/tests">tests</a> for <a href="https://github.com/joshkgarber/masters-with-agents">Masters with Agents</a>.</p><h2>Web Components</h2><p>I rekindled my joy of working with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements">autonomous custom elements</a>. I don't think I can describe succinctly why I enjoy working with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements">custom web components</a> so much. It just feels so good to be back at it again!</p><p>I started a project called <a href="https://github.com/joshkgarber/lutenant">lutenant</a> (working title) which will showcase my work via the creation of a component library. The idea is to create custom web components for InContext and other future apps. I aim to focus first on tables and cards.</p><p>I see this working really well as a complement to a templating tool like Jinja. You would do some basic rendering on the server side to insert the components with a simple HTML tag. For example, with the tag <code>&lt;lut-table data-spec="{{ table_spec }}">&lt;/lut-table></code>, the table will create itself on the front end using information found in <code>table_spec</code> which can include fetching data from the server. I haven't figured out exactly what <code>table_spec</code> is, but it could include:</p><ul><li>all of the table data, or</li><li>some of the table data, or</li><li>none of the table data, but rather information needed to query the table data from a dedicated route on the server.</li></ul><p>The solution I use at first will be designed specifically for InContext. Maybe it will involve having the component fetch the table data from a new route on the blueprint called <code>tabledata</code>. For example:</p><pre><code>@bp.route("/tabledata", methods=("GET",))
@login_required
def tabledata():
    ...
    return tabledata</code></pre><p>The best way to use fetch and JSON with Flask is documented <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/patterns/javascript/">here</a>. I plan to use this as a reference when it comes to integrating lutenant with InContext.</p><h2>Gratitude</h2><p>I'm grateful for the freedom to pursue programming as a profession. It's something that I've always gravitated towards, and I've always enjoyed it, and had an immense amount of fun doing it.</p></div></article>
