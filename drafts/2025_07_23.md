- Inheritance of css on web components through to open shadow. closed shadow too?
- Created blog project from ssg. Fixed regex for links (catching brackets). Found bug in the way codeblocks are parsed (can't have a new paragraph in a codeblock). I need to stop updating both ssg and blog. I only need blog now so I'm not going to bother creating a program I can run from anywhere.
- I should move jkgarber.com to joshkgarber.com and put a link to my blog there. After I do some more courses on boot.dev (like ci/cd) I might be able to move blog to the droplet.
- Just put the id in the web component attributes and pull the data via fetch. That's lots of fetch calls but there are advantages:
    - You can use cache on repeated calls
    - You make server side processes smaller and faster
    - cache means that the server runs processes when they're actually needed. Note: not sure if this is a distinct advantage of using fetch or if the cache really works on the server side as well/instead of between the client and server.
    - given it's a single-threaded system (python), the items in the queue will be smaller and therefore the queue will move faster. different users requests can be processed in succession. i guess this is also venturing into the load-balancing area/topic.
